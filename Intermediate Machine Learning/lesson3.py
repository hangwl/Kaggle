# Categorical Variables

# 3 basic approaches:

# 1. Drop categorical variables
# 2. Ordinal Encoding - assign each unique value to a different integer
# 3. One-Hot Encoding - create new columns indicating the presence (or absence) of each possible value in the original data

# In general, approach #3 will typically perform best, and approach #1 the worst, but it varies on a case-by-case basis
